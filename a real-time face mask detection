##Implementing a real-time face mask detector involves using computer vision techniques and deep learning. 
You can start by collecting a dataset of images with and without masks.
Then follow these general steps:

Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather a diverse dataset of images containing people with and without masks. Split the dataset into training and validation sets. Preprocess the images by resizing, normalizing, and augmenting them.

Model Selection:
Choose a suitable deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and select a pre-trained model architecture like MobileNet, ResNet, or YOLO, which are commonly used for object detection tasks.

Model Training:
Fine-tune the chosen model on your mask dataset. You can use transfer learning to leverage features learned on a large dataset and then adapt them to your specific task. Train the model using the training data and monitor its performance on the validation set.

Object Detection:
Use the trained model for object detection to identify faces and determine whether a mask is present or not. You'll need to modify the model's output layer to include mask-related classes.

Real-time Detection:
Integrate the model with a webcam feed or video stream. Use OpenCV or other similar libraries to capture frames and pass them through the model for inference in real-time.

Display Results:
Draw bounding boxes around detected faces and label them as "With Mask" or "Without Mask." Overlay this information on the video feed or webcam stream.

Post-processing:
Apply non-maximum suppression to remove duplicate detections and refine the results. This helps to have cleaner and more accurate output.

Deployment:
Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to the desired platform. This could be a local computer, server, or even embedded systems like Raspberry Pi.
